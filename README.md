# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

This study guide provides useful tips or information for a beginner to the Bootcamp. It incorporates information about HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript, so that when you (the possible beginner) is lost or requires addition information, this web app is the place to go! I learned that coding is an on-going process and will be adding more information as I continue through my coding journey.

Happy Coding!
